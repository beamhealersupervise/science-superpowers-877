Science Superpowers is a complete computational-science methodology for your research agents, built on a set of composable skills plus initial instructions that make sure your agent actually uses them. It has **zero third-party dependencies** — it runs with only your agent harness and a POSIX shell.

It is a reimplementation of [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) (a software-development methodology) for a different domain: doing science with data. The architecture is the same — skills that auto-trigger via a session-start bootstrap — but the workflow is the research lifecycle, and the central discipline is **pre-registration** instead of test-driven development.

## How it works

It starts the moment you fire up your agent. As soon as it sees you're trying to investigate something, it *doesn't* jump straight into running code on your data. Instead it steps back and helps you turn a fuzzy interest into a precise, falsifiable question.

Once the question is clear, it grounds the work in prior literature and standard methods, designs the analysis, and **pre-registers** the hypotheses, predictions, and decision rules *before looking at the outcomes*. That separation — confirmatory vs. exploratory, predictions locked before data — is what protects the work from p-hacking and HARKing (hypothesizing after results are known).

Then it executes the pre-registered plan in a reproducible workspace (pinned environment, fixed seeds, immutable raw data), investigates anomalies by root cause instead of quietly dropping inconvenient data, verifies every claim against fresh reproduced evidence, and red-teams the result before reporting it.

Because the skills trigger automatically, you don't need to do anything special. Your research agent just has Science Superpowers.

## The basic workflow

**The agent checks for relevant skills before any task.** Mandatory workflows, not suggestions.

## Example: what using it looks like

You don't invoke anything. You just talk to your agent like normal — the skills trigger themselves.

> **You:** I have last quarter's churn data. Does our new onboarding flow reduce churn?

A vanilla agent would load the CSV and start slicing. With Science Superpowers, the agent steps back first:

> **Agent:** Before touching the data, let me frame this precisely (`framing-research-questions`). The question is whether the new onboarding flow *causes* lower 90-day churn — but users weren't randomly assigned to it, so cohort and seasonality are confounders. Here's the falsifiable version, the data we'd need, and what would count as an answer…
>
> *[surveys prior internal analyses and standard methods, then designs the analysis]*
>
> **Agent:** I'm now **pre-registering** the hypothesis, the directional prediction (new flow → lower churn), and the decision rule **before** I look at any outcome (`preregistering-analysis`). Everything beyond this that wasn't pre-registered will be labeled exploratory.
>
> *[runs the pre-registered plan in a pinned, seeded, reproducible workspace; an anomaly appears]*
>
> **Agent:** One cohort shows implausibly low churn. Rather than dropping it, I'm root-causing it (`investigating-anomalous-results`) — it turns out to be a logging gap, not a real effect.
>
> *[verifies every claim against freshly reproduced output, then red-teams its own conclusion before reporting]*

The result is an analysis where the confirmatory claims are protected from p-hacking and HARKing, the anomalies were explained rather than hidden, and every number can be reproduced.

## What's inside

### Skills library

**Execution**
- **[subagent-driven-analysis](skills/subagent-driven-analysis/SKILL.md)** — Fresh subagent per analysis step with two-stage review
- **[executing-analysis](skills/executing-analysis/SKILL.md)** — Inline batch execution with checkpoints

- **[receiving-critical-review](skills/receiving-critical-review/SKILL.md)** — Respond to critique with rigor, not performative agreement

**Workspace & reporting**
- **[setting-up-reproducible-analysis](skills/setting-up-reproducible-analysis/SKILL.md)** — Isolated, reproducible workspace
- **[reporting-and-archiving-findings](skills/reporting-and-archiving-findings/SKILL.md)** — Decide how to report; archive code, data, environment

**Meta**
- **[writing-science-skills](skills/writing-science-skills/SKILL.md)** — Create new skills following the testing methodology
- **[using-science-superpowers](skills/using-science-superpowers/SKILL.md)** — Introduction to the skills system

## Philosophy

- **Pre-registration** — State predictions and decision rules before seeing outcomes
- **Confirmatory vs. exploratory** — Always labeled, never blurred
- **Reproducibility** — Pinned environments, fixed seeds, immutable raw data
- **Evidence over claims** — Verify before declaring a finding
- **Root cause over patching** — Investigate anomalies; don't quietly drop data


### Cursor

In Cursor Agent chat, install from the plugin marketplace, or point Cursor at this repository as a plugin. The `sessionStart` hook (`hooks/hooks-cursor.json`) loads the bootstrap automatically.

### Claude Code

Register a marketplace pointing at this repo (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) and install the `science-superpowers` plugin. The `SessionStart` hook (`hooks/hooks.json`) loads the bootstrap.

### Codex

Use the committed Codex manifest at `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.

### Gemini CLI

Install as an extension; `gemini-extension.json` points the context file at `GEMINI.md`, which loads the bootstrap and the Gemini tool mapping.

### OpenCode

See [.opencode/INSTALL.md](.opencode/INSTALL.md).

### Google Antigravity

Antigravity natively supports Agent Skills (the same `SKILL.md` format) and reads `GEMINI.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `.agent/rules/` as always-on rules at session start. Install the skills and load the bootstrap rule — see [.antigravity/INSTALL.md](.antigravity/INSTALL.md).

## Contributing

See `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` for contributor guidelines, and `skills/writing-science-skills/SKILL.md` for the complete guide to creating and testing skills.
